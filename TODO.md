# TODO

- configure size of thumbnails
- handle scaling factor for hdpi screens
- Implement the ability to pick / reject a picture
- Bind the values stored within the application to the UI. 
  That is the directory tree and the pictures within the directory.
  These should be updated by updating the state, that is
  querying the database.
- Implement the abilty to change the sort order of the files. This should be
  in chronological order to begin with, sorted from the datbase. 
  This will be the fallback sorting, with the ability to sort by filename
  and to reverse the sort order.

## DONE
- Sort the pictures from the database.
- Update then UI when a new directory is added
